NOTE: PhishingKitTracker used to be one large .CSV file but it got too big to manage so it has been split into monthly files.  If you would like the original 1 large combined file please perform the following commands in linux to combine them.
    1.) wget https://github.com/neonprimetime/PhishingKitTracker/archive/master.zip
    2.) unzip master.zip 
    3.) cat PhishingKitTracker-master/*_PhishingKitTracker.csv > PhishingKitTracker.csv
